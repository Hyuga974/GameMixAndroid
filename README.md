# Tests
We have three main types of tests: Security, Functional (Working), and Structural.

- **Functional Tests:** Verify that the software functions as expected from the user's perspective.
- **Structural Tests:** Verify that each component of the software functions correctly internally.
- **Security Tests:** Verify that the software is secure against potential threats and vulnerabilities.
