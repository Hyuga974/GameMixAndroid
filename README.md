# Work in Progress
See you soon for more things ðŸ˜‰  
Currently working on the CI/CD pipeline to automate build and test processes.

# Tests

## Unit Tests
Unit tests verify individual functionalities such as validation, data integrity, and single component behavior.

### US001 - User Registration
- Valid pseudonym registration
- Pseudonym already used
- Empty pseudonym
- Too short / too long pseudonym
- Pseudonym with special characters or spaces

## E2E Tests
E2E tests simulate full user flows from game creation to interaction with external devices.

### US011 - Full Game Management
- Create a new game, add players, and start it

### US012 - Score Management In-Game

### US014 - Bluetooth Resilience
- Clear error feedback for all connection issues

### US015 - Multi-Resolution Support *(optional / UI-level)*
- Responsive layout on tablets and rotated screens

## Security Tests
Security tests ensure privacy, data safety, and robust permission handling.

### US012 - Permission Handling
- Request justifications for missing permissions
- Graceful degradation on refusal
- Feature deactivation after revocation

### US013 - Bluetooth Security
- Encrypted connections during pairing
- Reject unauthorized devices
- Terminate on man-in-the-middle detection

### US014 - Data Protection
- Stored game data is encrypted
- Other apps cannot access the sandbox
- Data stays unreadable on rooted devices

**OWASP Top 10 Compliance**:  
Relevant OWASP Top 10 risks are evaluated and mitigated:
- **A01:2021 â€“ Broken Access Control** â†’ Scoped permissions & validation before actions
- **A02:2021 â€“ Cryptographic Failures** â†’ Encrypted storage and Bluetooth pairing
- **A03:2021 â€“ Injection** â†’ No dynamic SQL; parameterized queries only
- **A05:2021 â€“ Security Misconfiguration** â†’ Secure defaults for Gradle builds and permissions
- **A07:2021 â€“ Identification and Authentication Failures** â†’ Pseudonym validation and session handling
- **A09:2021 â€“ Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** â†’ CI/CD logs and crash reports stored securely

## Structural Tests
These verify internal code logic: branching, conditions, and edge case handling.

### US015 - Conditional Branch Coverage
- â‰¥80% code coverage on critical modules
- All branches tested (including edge cases)
- Add missing tests for uncovered paths

## Setting Up Deployment and Testing Environments with Performance and Quality Monitoring Tools

For the **GameMix Android** project, a set of tools and technologies has been selected to ensure a structured, traceable, and high-quality development process.

---

### 1. Development Environment

Development is carried out using **Android Studio**, on systems running **Windows 11** and **Manjaro Linux**.

The codebase is written in **Kotlin 1.9.20**, compiled with **Java 20**, and built using **Gradle 8.11.1**.

The project relies on modern Android libraries, including **Jetpack Compose**, **Navigation**, and **Datastore**.

---

### 2. Tools and Technologies

- **Version Control**: Git (hosted on GitHub)
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions (basic structure implemented, deployment in progress)
- **Code Quality Monitoring**: SonarQube (static analysis and maintainability tracking)
- **Test Coverage**: JaCoCo (currently being configured for unit testing coverage)
- **Containerization (planned)**: Docker (for automated testing environments)

#### Quality & Coverage Badges:

### 3. Deployment Pipeline (in progress)

The goal is to implement a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, with the following stages:

1. **Build the application** using `./gradlew build`
2. **Run unit tests** with `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
3. **Generate test coverage reports** via JaCoCo
4. **Perform SonarQube analysis**
5. *(optional / future)* **Deploy APK** to Firebase App Distribution or a Docker-based emulator

This pipeline is still under development but follows an incremental and scalable approach.

---

### 4. Quality and Performance Objectives

- Code is continuously analyzed through **SonarQube** to detect complexity issues, duplication, and convention violations.
- **JaCoCo integration** (in progress) will allow tracking **unit test coverage**, especially for critical business logic.
- Performance monitoring tools like **Android Profiler** or **Firebase Performance Monitoring** may be added later for runtime analysis.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: UI components are tested against [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) guidelines using automated accessibility scans (Accessibility Scanner) and manual validation on Android devices.

# Quality and Performance Indicators

- **Code Coverage**: Target â‰¥ 80% on critical modules (measured via JaCoCo)
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Target < 10 per method (tracked in SonarQube)
- **Code Duplication**: Target < 5% (SonarQube)
- **Bugs & Vulnerabilities**: 0 blocker in production
- **UI Performance**: Navigation between screens < 500 ms
- **Bluetooth Stability**: Successful connection rate > 95%
- **Accessibility Compliance**: â‰¥ 95% of UI screens passing WCAG 2.1 AA automated checks

---

# Review Process and Non-Conformity Management

- **Pull Requests required** for all changes, with manual review and SonarQube analysis before merge
- **CI test failure procedure**:
  1. Identify failing commit via GitHub Actions logs
  2. Fix in a dedicated branch
  3. Re-run tests before merging
- **Post-deployment bug**: Create a GitHub issue with the `bug` label and link to the impacted user story

---

# Automated Reports

- **JaCoCo report**: `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`
- **SonarQube report**: Available on [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Hyuga974_GameMixAndroid)
- **Build artifacts**: APK downloadable from the GitHub Actions *Actions* tab

---

# Tools Ensuring Tracking

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates build, test, and static analysis
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security monitoring
- **JaCoCo**: Unit test coverage tracking
- *(planned)* **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: Real-world performance metrics
- **Accessibility Scanner**: Automated WCAG compliance checks

# Development Team

This project was developed solo by [**Costa Reype**](#https://github.com/Hyuga974), who assumed all key roles throughout the development process â€” from planning to deployment.
